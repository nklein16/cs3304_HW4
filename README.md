# cs3304_HW4
Assignment 4 in my Data Structures (CS 3304) course - Implement a set using the author's set code and using a dynamic array.  Written in C++. 

Assignment #4 was an extension of Assignment #3.  In that assignment, we were to implement Problem #3 on page 149.
For Assignment #4, we were to do the same, but for a set instead of a sequence, and using a dynamic array rather than a static one.
